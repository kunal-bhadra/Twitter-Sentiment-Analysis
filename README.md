# Covid Sentiment Map Dashboard

The Covid Sentiment Map is a Dashboard from where you can check the Sentiments of the Indian population through an interactive map. Through a Choropleth overview, you can look at the spatial variation of the emotions surrounding major Covid-related events in India throughout 2021 and 2022, and **understand how people in certain states might have felt about a certain time/event**.
