The Covid Sentiment Map is a Dashboard from where you can check the Sentiments of the Indian public through an interactive map. Through a Choropleth map, you can look at the spatial variation of the emotions surrounding major Covid-related events in India throughout 2021 and 2022, and understand how certain states might have felt about a certain time/event.
